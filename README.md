# Mother-Beta

An interactive emotional experience about becoming a mother without ever being taught how.

## Overview

**Mother-Beta** puts the player into the role of someone trying to care for a child while feeling unprepared, anxious, and overwhelmed. Through clicking, rhythm control, repeated failure, and moments of stillness, the system simulates emotional chaos.

The game world resists control: buttons move away, tasks reset, sounds escalate, and visual feedback becomes unstable. As the player gradually finds rhythm—or chooses to pause and stay still—the system begins to respond with calmer feedback. The emotional arc builds toward: **"She learned to keep going."**

## Core Emotional Design

- **Anxiety and instability:** Input does not always produce immediate or predictable results.
- **Repetition and fatigue:** Tasks reappear to reflect the endless nature of caregiving.
- **Embodied frustration:** Movement, timing, and interruption are used as emotional mechanics.
- **Recovery through rhythm:** Calm emerges when the player discovers pacing and persistence.

## Interaction Flow (Experience Stages)

1. **Start**
	- Player enters a seemingly simple caregiving scenario.

2. **Uncatchable child**
	- The “button” behaves like a crawling child and keeps moving away.
	- Player tries to catch/control it but repeatedly fails.

3. **Toys everywhere**
	- Toys are scattered across the scene.
	- Player must put toys into a basket, but they keep coming back out.

4. **Accumulated frustration**
	- After many attempts, system text appears:
	- _"Motherhood is complicated and repetitive. It was never meant to be easy."_

5. **AI child dialogue (LLM)**
	- An AI-generated “child voice” says random, messy, emotional lines.
	- Player replies 2–3 times.
	- LLM responds dynamically, reflecting confusion, need, and attachment.

6. **Noise and meltdown**
	- Loud, chaotic crying/noise builds up.
	- Input pressure and sensory stress peak.

7. **Sudden silence**
	- Audio cuts out unexpectedly.
	- A brief stillness creates emotional contrast.

8. **No real ending**
	- Prompt: _"Did you think it was over?"_
	- The experience has no true finish; caregiving is continuous.
	- System can randomly jump back to another difficult phase.

## System Mechanics

- **Moving targets:** Interface elements evade interaction.
- **Delayed or disrupted sound:** Audio timing creates unease and loss of control.
- **Visual misalignment/glitch offsets:** The screen subtly destabilizes perception.
- **Persistence detection:** If player stabilizes rhythm or stays still, feedback softens.
- **Looping challenge states:** Progress is emotional, not linear completion.

## Planned LLM Features

- **Dynamic text feedback:** Each run generates context-sensitive narrative responses.
- **Memory fragments:** The system surfaces short “memory shards” tied to player behavior.
- **Unique sessions:** No two playthroughs are identical, increasing immersion and psychological depth.

## Creative Goal

To communicate that caregiving is not a clean sequence of success states, but a cycle of effort, breakdown, adaptation, and endurance. The project aims to make players *feel* that process—not just observe it.
