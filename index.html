            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Mother-Beta</strong> puts the player into the role of someone trying to care for a child while feeling unprepared, anxious, and overwhelmed. Through clicking, rhythm control, repeated failure, and moments of stillness, the system simulates emotional chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game world resists control: buttons move away, tasks reset, sounds escalate, and visual feedback becomes unstable. As the player gradually finds rhythm—or chooses to pause and stay still—the system begins to respond with calmer feedback. The emotional arc builds toward: <strong>"She learned to keep going."</strong>
